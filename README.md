Hi everyone,
- You can also create folders by using **folderName/fileName.cpp** (no extension = folder)

Be sure to include documentation!
Example:
```javascript
/*
	functionName(a,b)
	@Precondition: a must be intialized to something, etc...
	@Postcondition: sometehing is changed
	@return
*/
```


Remember the following Git commands:

1. **git pull**  downloads changes

2. **git commit -a** commits changes

3. **git push** or **git push origin master** push changes
